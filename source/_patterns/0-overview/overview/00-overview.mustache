                <p>ACT Government single public face (SPF) UI Kit 1.0 is an iterative style guide that contains self-contained
                    interface designs and related code. The purpose of the SPF UI Kit 1.0 is to create a consistent style
                    and core functionality across the collective ACT Government online presence. The UI kit itself is structured
                    using atomic design approach and is built in the open source Pattern Lab platform.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" rel="external" target="_blank">Atomic design</a></h2>
                <p>Atomic design is a design methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface
                    design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner. The five stages of atomic design are: Atoms,
                    Molecules, Organisms, Templates and Pages </p>

                <h2><a href="http://patternlab.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">Pattern Lab</a></h2>
                <p>Pattern Lab is a tool and language agnostic platform used documents interface components and digital style.
                    It facilitates the atomic design approach documenting interface components, patterns and annotations.</p>

                <p>SPF UI 1.0 is the starting point for re invigorating the ACT Governments online presence. The UI kit provides
                    core components that can be used to redesign existing sites. These components are deconstructed into
                    smaller part allowing them to be used to build other more advanced components when needed. Using these
                    building smaller blocks to create new components will ensure that the ACT Government online style is
                    maintained across different interface elements and sites.</p>

                <p>SPF UI Kit also integrates the existing <a href="https://github.com/govau/uikit" rel="external" target="_blank">GOVAU UI Kit 2.0</a>.
                    The two kits have been integrated so that further developments from the DTA and other government agencies
                    can be leveraged as part of ACT Governments SPF Kit. This has been achieved by maintaining theme and
                    class naming conventions established in GOVAU UI kit. Updated and new components from GOVAU can be brought
                    into Pattern Lab with minor modifications.</p>
